# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value & Optimal Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Campaigns

**Overview:**

This project analyzes customer data from a retail business to predict customer lifetime value (CLTV) and identify optimal customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.  The analysis employs machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their predicted CLTV, allowing for the creation of tailored marketing strategies designed to maximize return on investment (ROI).  The project includes data preprocessing, CLTV prediction modeling, customer segmentation, and visualization of key findings.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** Execute the main script using: `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including summary statistics of CLTV predictions and details about the identified customer segments.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `cltv_distribution.png`, `segment_comparison.png`), providing visual representations of the CLTV distribution and the characteristics of each customer segment.  These plots are saved in the `output` directory.


**Data:**

The project requires a CSV file named `customer_data.csv` located in the `data` directory. This file should contain relevant customer information such as purchase history, demographics, and other relevant features.  A sample `customer_data.csv` file is included for demonstration purposes.  Note that you may need to modify the code to match your specific data structure.
